This repository is strictly used to store a personal minecraft server. Please ignore this repository.
If for some reason you want to host your own server, follow the steps below.

In the file "server.properties", fill in the "server-ip" field with your own local/public IP.
  To find your IP in windows: ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4"
  To find you IP in linux/macOS: ifconfig | grep inet

If you want to house a new server:
  Delete all the files except for eula.txt, server.properties, and server.jar
Else (for some reason, you want to play on my world):
  do_nothing

To start the serever, use "java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui" -- must have java installed.
I am assuming you know how to join a server, if not, why are you even here... 
  "join server" [IP_ADDRESS:PORT]
